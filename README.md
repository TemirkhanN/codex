# CODEX

# NO

- Ternary operators; (hard testing)
- Fluent interface entities; (code polution)
- Variables in quotes; (bad visual code-reading)
- {@Inheritdoc} usage; (excess parent exploration)
- Public or protected variables; (potential prohibited usage)

## YES

- Foolproof comments; (transparent domain model)
- Everything but testing class is mock; (no fooling code coverage; clear tests;);
